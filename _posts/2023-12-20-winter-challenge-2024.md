<br />

### Goal
To commit to F3 Blue Ridge and your fellow PAX to live out the three Fs: Fellowship, Fitness, and Faith during the frigid winter months. We have designed this three-month-long commitment to be a challenge, but don’t be intimidated. Embrace the suck with your brothers, get better, and earn a shirt only a select few will ever be able to wear.

<br /><br />

### Duration
January 1st through March 31st.

<br /><br />

### Cost
$25 – You will earn a custom F3 Blue Ridge shirt designed by Raphael himself once you complete the requirements of the Challenge. We will donate the funds of those who do not meet the Challenge to the F3 Blue Ridge Community Outreach Fund.
