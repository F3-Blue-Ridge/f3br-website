What is Rucking? Walking with a weighted rucksack (aka backpack) is a low impact exercise based on military training workouts. Whether you decide to Ruck, Walk, or Run, come see the beautiful scenery of West Virginia while you build camaraderie with other men. Everyone starts and ends at the same point, and depending on your goals we push each other and always pick up the six. Whether you are training for a personal best run, training for a ruck event (GrowRuck Training Event), or just want to meet like minded men in conversation, there is something for everyone.
