IronWorks is founded upon “Iron sharpening Iron”. Town of Stephens City, Virginia was known for its Newtown Wagon which took not just one, but several Blacksmiths in the area to produce the high quality wagons known for their sheer size and ability to haul. The Blacksmiths would each craft their own part of the wagon that they specialized in and craftsmen would collaborate on the construction of the wagon. This is what F3 is about, every man brings something to the AO and we come together to create a fun group that embraces challenges, demonstrates courage and continues to make each other better everytime we post. IronWorks likes to bring a full body workout every Tuesday evening and has been known to enjoy a late workout game that will continue the cardio aspects of the workout. All men are welcome as always, but we have a very cool father and 2.0 connection at IronWorks and we want you to join us. If you have never experienced a Rush Hour BeatDown, you definitely need to come check it out.
