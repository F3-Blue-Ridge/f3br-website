<p>Welcome to AO The Burg!  The Burg proudly boasts not only the Town Hall Lawn for our normal beatdowns, but a full parking garage/stairs and a ‘heated’ basement for those extra cold mornings (hence the nickname “The Bougie”)!  If this is your first time, don’t fret! We are always excited to see a new guy show up on a gloomy morning for a workout!  We will go out of our way to make you feel welcome.</p>

<br />

<p>We’re proud to have hosted <span class="dotted-underline" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="This is what we call members of F3.">PAX</span> from teenagers to men in their late 60s! We are all at different fitness levels, but we start together and most importantly, we finish together.  After just a few workouts, you’ll find yourself not just getting physically stronger, but emotionally stronger as well.</p>

<br />

<p>Come on out and see why so many people choose to workout at The Burg.</p>
