We are AO KODIAK! We are in the foothills of Round Hill Va,
The group is peer-led, meaning that members take turns leading workouts and creating exercise routines. We focus on fitness and wellness activities that take place on the open fields of Round Hill Elementary School using its surrounding area to our advantage.

<br />

Our group offers a variety of workout options, including cardio exercises, agility drills, Every minute on the minute (EMOM) and High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). Workouts may involve activities such as running, bodyweight exercises, circuit training, and team-based challenges.

<br />

Being held outdoors allows AO-KODIAK members to enjoy the fresh air, natural surroundings, and the changing scenery of Round Hill. Exercising outdoors also provides the opportunity to connect with nature and reap the benefits of outdoor exercise.

<br />

AO-KODIAK offers a supportive and inclusive environment for people of all fitness levels and abilities. Whether someone is a beginner or an experienced athlete, they can participate and modify exercises according to their own capabilities. The group fosters a sense of camaraderie and motivation through group challenges, encouragement, and shared goals. By bringing together like-minded individuals who prioritize fitness and an active lifestyle, AO-KODIAK creates a community where members can have fun, achieve their fitness goals, and support one another in their wellness journey.
