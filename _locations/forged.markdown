Forged is for those members of the world who are slightly more seasoned, who remember what it was like to do long math and get work done on paper! This is for men who have earned their "Mentor Card through life experience". For some, this may be a stroll, but this is a walking group, with occasional band or stretching movements. For the less seasoned men, wear a rucksack, walk and listen! Men, all men need what F3 brings and as we stress modify as necessary to these men, the thought of even trying a burpee would put them into traction and that's okay. For some hard chargers that are still getting down, that's awesome, but "Forged" is about encouraging movement, along with the two other elements that make it an F3 group, fellowship and faith!
