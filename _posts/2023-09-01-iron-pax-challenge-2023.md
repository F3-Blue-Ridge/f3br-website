A little over 5 years ago some of the men of F3 Greenwood were sitting around at coffeteria, boasting of their athletic prowess. That conversation – “he can run faster than me but I can do more pull-ups than him” – led these men to thinking of what it would take to create a local competition to see just who was the best PAX in the Region. Pretty soon, the challenge went from being a local challenge to a national one.

<br />

After a few rounds of sugar free vanilla soy lattes and nonfat, mocha frappuccinos with whip, the IronPAX Challenge (IPC) was born.

<br />
Knowing that men are competitive by nature, the IPC is intended to challenge all men of F3 Nation by requiring you to perform to a strict standard. Historically, the challenge takes place during the month of Semptember and consists of four, weekly workouts.

<br />
At it’s core, the IPC is a “You vs You” competition, designed to push you beyond what you think you can do.
