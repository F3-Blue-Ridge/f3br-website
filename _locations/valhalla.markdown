We are AO Valhalla!  Join us on the turf field at 0530 on Tuesdays and 0700 on Sundays for Power Stretching and Mobility (PS&M). Youâ€™ll feel more limber and you will take care of aches and pains from working out, sitting too much, or just life in general.  Mutombo has found these workouts to be more effective than physical therapy to alleviate tight hips and lower back pain.  Dial Tone attributes these sessions to keeping him mostly pain and injury free at 55 years old, allowing him to work out on a consistent basis and stay in phenomenal shape. Valhalla is located on the turf practice field at Loudoun Valley High School, 340 N Maple Ave in Purcellville.
