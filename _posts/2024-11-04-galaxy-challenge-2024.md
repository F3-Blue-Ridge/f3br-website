### Goal
  The goal of the challenge will be to Post at all 8 AO’s in the given timeframe.  There is no requirement to Q, but if you are visiting why not mix it up?  This will give us all the opportunity to get a little out of our comfort zones, build stronger relationships within Blue Ridge, and help spread some variety to a couple AO’s that are currently undermanned at the moment. At the end of the year we'll tally the number of PAX who completed the challenge and get some patches done up!

<br /><br />

### Duration
The Blue Ridge Galaxy Challenge will run from Nov 4th - Dec 31st.
