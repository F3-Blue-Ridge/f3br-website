We are AO The Burn, taking our beatdowns right in the heart of Ashburn at Stone Bridge High School. The Burn started as an offshoot of The Burg and continues to grow into its own set of regulars. The Burn meets just once a week right now, on Thursday mornings, likely building to multiple beatdowns per week as the core group grows. The enormous parking lot and open athletic practice field provide ample for a diverse workout approaches, often including the Â¼ mile flat, lighted loop of the parking lot. (Yes, we like to run at The Burn!) Overall the Burn is new, growing, and hopeful to pull in lots of Friendly New Guys from all the neighborhoods surrounding SBHS.
